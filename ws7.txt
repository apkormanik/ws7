My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14
US	53000124	R1KJ6MB7MRSQFF	0805076069	145341889	Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream	Books	4	9	11	N	N	I viewed this the opposite of Publisher's Weekly ...	This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it alss[3;1Ho deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first timm[4;1He in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that werr[5;1He tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about thess[6;1He pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that thh[7;1Hese pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants suchh[8;1H as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things suu[9;1Hch as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt placc[10;1Hes of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only  [11;1Habout what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend itt[12;1H to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, yoo[14;1Hu'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.

It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about lifee[5;1H.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stoo[6;1Hpped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in  [7;1Hhis life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep ss[8;1Hchool he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of thoo[9;1Hse 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surpriss[11;1Hed however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.  [12;1HEhrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wann[13;1Hted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the  [14;1Hbook was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life ww[15;1Has like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bb[16;1Hizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mm[17;1Hind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a  [18;1Hcompletely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would hh[19;1Have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things woo[20;1Hrked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, II[21;1H thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employy[22;1Her offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in  [23;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;110H7,1[11C66%[1;1H[?25h[?25l[24;100H~@k[1;1H[24;100H   [1;1H[1;23r[1;1H[9M[1;24r[14;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.

When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas oo[17;1Hn opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks withoutt[18;1H keys, and that's it.

I was sort of surpriss[2;1Hed however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.  [3;1HEhrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wann[4;1Hted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the  [5;1Hbook was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life ww[6;1Has like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bb[7;1Hizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mm[8;1Hind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a  [9;1Hcompletely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would hh[10;1Have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things woo[11;1Hrked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, II[12;1H thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employy[13;1Her offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in  [14;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommendd[15;1H.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas oo[17;1Hn opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks withoutt[18;1H keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surpriss[11;1Hed however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.  [12;1HEhrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wann[13;1Hted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the  [14;1Hbook was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life ww[15;1Has like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bb[16;1Hizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mm[17;1Hind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a  [18;1Hcompletely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would hh[19;1Have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things woo[20;1Hrked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, II[21;1H thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employy[22;1Her offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in  [23;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;110H7,1[11C66%[1;1H[?25h[?25l[24;100H~@k[1;1H[24;100H   [1;1H[1;23r[1;1H[9M[1;24r[14;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.

When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative.

Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be  [15;1Hwell organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of  [16;1Hstrong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br  [17;1H/>We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;110H[K[24;110H6,1[11C50%[14;1H[?25h[?25l[24;100H~@k[14;1H[24;100H   [4;1H[1;23r[1;1H[3L[1;24r[1;1HIf you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.

I was sort of surpriss[2;1Hed however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.  [3;1HEhrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wann[4;1Hted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the  [5;1Hbook was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life ww[6;1Has like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bb[7;1Hizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mm[8;1Hind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a  [9;1Hcompletely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would hh[10;1Have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things woo[11;1Hrked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, II[12;1H thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employy[13;1Her offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in  [14;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommendd[15;1H.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas oo[17;1Hn opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks withoutt[18;1H keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surpriss[11;1Hed however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.  [12;1HEhrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wann[13;1Hted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the  [14;1Hbook was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life ww[15;1Has like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bb[16;1Hizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mm[17;1Hind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a  [18;1Hcompletely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would hh[19;1Have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things woo[20;1Hrked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, II[21;1H thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employy[22;1Her offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in  [23;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;110H7,1[11C66%[1;1H[?25h[?25l[24;100H~@k[1;1H[24;100H   [1;1H[1;23r[1;1H[9M[1;24r[14;1Hthe traditional sense she was seeking.

When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas oo[17;1Hn opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks withoutt[18;1H keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this boo[20;1Hok.

In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[9;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[10;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[11;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[12;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[13;1Hay they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought thosee[14;1H comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no ss[15;1Halary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditionaa[16;1Hl sense she was seeking.

In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[9;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[10;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[11;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[12;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[13;1Hay they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought thosee[14;1H comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no ss[15;1Halary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditionaa[16;1Hl sense she was seeking.

This book is cc[3;1Hhilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by  [4;1Hthe comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich cann[5;1H't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyzee[6;1H.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to dee[7;1Hscribe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when ss[8;1Hhe got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[9;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[10;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[11;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[12;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[13;1Hay they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought thosee[14;1H comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no ss[15;1Halary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditionaa[16;1Hl sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.     2005-10--[17;1H14[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;110H[K[24;110H8,1[11C87%[1;1H[?25h[?25l[1;23r[1;1H[10L[1;24r[1;1HUS      31048862[8CR2F53LI9KK9MOY  0316769487      862964341[7CThe Catcher in the Rye  Books   4[7C2[7C2       [2;1H N[7CN[7CInteresting, fun.[7CMy only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary onlyy[3;1H consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony.

In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[9;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[10;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[11;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[12;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[13;1Hay they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought thosee[14;1H comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no ss[15;1Halary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditionaa[16;1Hl sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.     2005-10--[17;1H14

Usage: sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

  -n, --quiet, --silent
                 suppress automatic printing of pattern space
      --debug
                 annotate program execution
  -e script, --expression=script
                 add the script to the commands to be executed
  -f script-file, --file=script-file
                 add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
  --follow-symlinks
                 follow symlinks when processing in place
  -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]
                 edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)
  -l N, --line-length=N
                 specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command
  --posix
                 disable all GNU extensions.
  -E, -r, --regexp-extended
                 use extended regular expressions in the script
                 (for portability use POSIX -E).
  -s, --separate
                 consider files as separate rather than as a single,
                 continuous long stream.
      --sandbox
                 operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).
  -u, --unbuffered
                 load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush
                 the output buffers more often
  -z, --null-data
                 separate lines by NUL characters
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then the first
non-option argument is taken as the sed script to interpret.  All
remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are
specified, then the standard input is read.

This book is cc[3;1Hhilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by  [4;1Hthe comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich cann[5;1H't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyzee[6;1H.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to dee[7;1Hscribe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when ss[8;1Hhe got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[9;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[10;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[11;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[12;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[13;1Hay they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought thosee[14;1H comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no ss[15;1Halary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditionaa[16;1Hl sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.     2005-10--[17;1H14[23;1H[94m@@@                                                                                                                            [m[24;1H[K[24;110H8,11-16[7C77%[1;16H[?25h[?25l[24;100H~@k[1;16H[24;100H   [1;16H[1;23r[1;1H[10L[1;24r[1;1HUS      31048862[8CR2F53LI9KK9MOY  0316769487      862964341[7CThe Catcher in the Rye  Books   4[7C2[7C2       [2;1H N[7CN[7CInteresting, fun.[7CMy only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary onlyy[3;1H consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony.

He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things hh[8;1He experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from  [9;1Hthe fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of.

This book is cc[13;1Hhilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by  [14;1Hthe comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed.

To me, the primary point of the book was to dee[17;1Hscribe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when ss[18;1Hhe got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreaa[19;1Hl experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAA[20;1HD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely diff[21;1Hferent book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the ss[22;1Hame from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the ww[23;1Hay they did.

The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side,  root for Daniel  Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized,  detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read  presentable manner. The use of strong  sound proofs by experiment  examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear  concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out  laid out so the reader can learn  follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative,  Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy  phony. It was still quite humorous  the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read  to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age  realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it,  wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home  tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling  depressing indeed, though very well written  sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there-- that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining  more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC  Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help  essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary  depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys,  that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity,  choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

Review based on  cursory examination by University of Phoenix students  Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well orgaa[17;1Hnized,  detailed.

This book is chilling  depressing indeed, though very well written  sprinkled with frequent humor.   was sort of surprised howee[10;1Hver by the comment  Publisher' Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreichh[11;1H can' deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed  the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyzz[12;1He.\\"   never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\"  the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to descc[13;1Hribe what  was like to actually try to ENTER that world  the first place rather than describing what life was like when she gott[14;1H there-- that she did.  In fact,  actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\"   sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiencess[15;1H she did--not only did  make for more entertaining  more thought-provoking reading, but  my mind,  she HAD obtained  job right  [16;1Haway,  would have taken away the whole raison 'etre of the book.  It would have been  completely different book  which she meree[17;1Hly described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, aa[18;1Ht least for purposes of writing the book,  think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the readee[19;1Hr who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC  Mary Kay,  thought those comments were bizarre.   agree wii[20;1Hth Ms. Ehrenreich' point  that \\"jobs\\" such as these  which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help   [21;1Hessentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs  the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, ' reaa[22;1Hlly  pretty scary  depressing book, but one which  recommend.

Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity,  choice of subject matter come together very nicely  this book.
